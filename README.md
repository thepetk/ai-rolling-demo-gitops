# RHDHPAI Rolling Demo GitOps

[![Nightly UI Tests](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-rolling-demo-gitops/actions/workflows/nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-rolling-demo-gitops/actions/workflows/nightly.yml)
[![ShellCheck](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-rolling-demo-gitops/actions/workflows/shellcheck.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-rolling-demo-gitops/actions/workflows/shellcheck.yaml)

The repository contains the gitops resources required to deploy an instance of the RHDHPAI rolling demo. The project is currently live at [rolling-demo-backstage-rolling-demo-ns.apps.rosa.redhat-ai-dev.m6no.p3.openshiftapps.com](https://rolling-demo-backstage-rolling-demo-ns.apps.rosa.redhat-ai-dev.m6no.p3.openshiftapps.com).

## Contents

The rolling demo combines the following components so far:

- The redhat developer hub chart ([rhdh-chart](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-chart)), in an attempt to keep the demo up-to-date with the latest changes of RHDH.
- The [AI software templates](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/ai-lab-template), a collection of Software Templates based on AI applications.
- The [Model Catalog Bridge](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/model-catalog-bridge) and the [catalog-backend-module-rhdh-ai](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/rhdh-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/rhdh-ai/plugins/catalog-backend-module-rhdh-ai) plugin. This mechanism provides a way to facilitate the seamless export of AI model records from Red Hat OpenShift AI and imports them into Red Hat Developer Hub (Backstage) as catalog entities.
- The [MCP Plugins](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/mcp-integrations), which provides a way for LLMs and AI applications to interact with Developer Hub.
- `Red Hat Developer Lightspeed` (Developer Lightspeed) is a virtual assistant powered by generative AI that offers in-depth insights into `Red Hat Developer Hub` (RHDH), including its wide range of capabilities.

## Capabilities & Limitations

### Access

- Access to the rolling demo is provided through Red Hat SSO.
- Every authenticated user has access to the AI software templates from the catalog. That said, you are able to choose the template you prefer and give it a try.

### AI Software Templates

- Currently our demo doesn't support deployment which require GPU.
- The rolling demo, currently supports only Github deployments. That said, you cannot use `Gitlab` as `Host Type` when installing the template.
- The github organization set to serve the demo is `ai-rolling-demo`, that said you need to keep it as the `Repository Owner`.
- Same applies for the `Image Organization` value. The `quay.io` repository corresponding to the demo is `rhdhpai-rolling-demo`.

### Gitlab Plugins Not Suported

- The GitLab catalog discovery plugins (`catalog-backend-module-gitlab-dynamic` and `catalog-backend-module-gitlab-org-dynamic`) are currently disabled. The demo uses GitHub as its only SCM integration and these plugins require a `catalog.providers.gitlab.default.host` configuration that is not available.

### Model Catalog Bridge

- A pre-requisite for the model catalog bridge to work is a running Red Hat OpenShift AI instance, so the bridge can fetch all registered models and add them to RHDH as catalog entities.

### Limited Application Lifecycle

- In order to avoid overprovisioning of resources, the rolling demo uses a `pruner` cronjob that deletes all Software Template applications that are older than 24 hours. That means that all the openshift **and** github resources (deployments, repositories, argocd applications, etc.) are removed.

## Development Branch & Lifecycle

The repository maintains a `development` branch that serves as the integration branch for new changes before they reach the production (AI Rolling Demo) instance in RHDHAI DevCluster.

### Branch Strategy

| Branch        | ArgoCD Application | Namespace            | Purpose                                |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `main`        | `rolling-demo`     | `rolling-demo-ns`    | Production instance, tracks `HEAD`     |
| `development` | `rhdhai-rhdh-dev`  | `rhdhai-development` | Staging instance, tracks `development` |

### Lifecycle

1. **Develop** — New changes (plugin updates, config changes, chart updates) are committed to the `development` branch.
2. **Validate** — The `rhdhai-rhdh-dev` ArgoCD application automatically syncs from the `development` branch, deploying the changes to the `rhdhai-development` namespace for testing.
3. **Promote** — Once validated, changes are merged into `main`. The `rolling-demo` production application picks them up automatically via ArgoCD's self-heal and auto-sync policies.

## Keeping RHDH Plugins Up-to-Date

### The Plugin Updater (`plugins-updater.yaml`) Workflow

The plugin updater workflow runs nightly (and can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`) to keep all RHDH plugins pinned to their latest available versions.

**What it does:**

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Runs the [`redhat-ai-dev/rhdh-plugin-gitops-updater`](https://github.com/redhat-ai-dev/rhdh-plugin-gitops-updater) action against `charts/rhdh/values.yaml`.
3. Scans all `oci:` plugin image tags with the prefixes `bs_`, and resolves the latest available version for each.
4. Opens a **pull request**, targeting the `development` branch, for each plugin that has a new version available.

This automation ensures that our gitops environment uses always the latest stable versions of rhdh plugins.
Once we have sufficiently validated the changes to the `development` branch and want to update the `main` branch, we will manually open a PR from `development` to `main`.

### The RHDH Image Updater (`rhdh-image-updater.yaml`) Workflow

Runs nightly (or manually via `workflow_dispatch`). Reads the current `MAJOR.MAJOR-MINOR` tag (e.g. `1.10-123`) from `charts/rhdh/values.yaml`, queries `quay.io/rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9` for the highest minor number available under the same `MAJOR.MAJOR-` prefix, and opens a PR against `development` if a newer tag is found. The major version is never bumped automatically. Any previously open PR for an older tag is automatically closed and its branch deleted.

## Getting Started Guide

A guide covering RHDH fundamentals—navigation, the Software Catalog, TechDocs, APIs, Templates, Search, and Developer Lightspeed—can be found in [catalog-docs/getting-started-rhdh/index.md](./catalog-docs/getting-started-rhdh/index.md).

## Rolling demo setup

Some instructions on how to setup an instance of the rolling demo on your own can be found in [docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md](./docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md).

Two install paths are available:

| Command                 | Cluster requirements                     | What's included                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `make install`          | GPU-capable nodes (`g5.2xlarge`+), RHOAI | Full stack: RHDH, Lightspeed, Model Catalog Bridge, AI Software Templates      |
| `make install-no-rhoai` | Any OCP cluster (no GPU required)        | RHDH, Lightspeed, AI Software Templates — **no** Model Catalog Bridge or RHOAI |

Use `make install-no-rhoai` when you want to run the demo on a smaller cluster that does not have GPU nodes or Red Hat OpenShift AI.

## Troubleshooting

### I cannot login to the rolling demo

If it is your first time accessing our cluster, keep in mind that we have an automation in place to register new users, so you might have to wait a few minutes for this process to be completed. If, after your second attempt you still have a problem accessing the rolling demo instance you please ping `team-rhdhpai` in the `#forum-rhdh-plugins-and-ai` slack channel.
